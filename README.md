Project Share Etsy listing using Google+ API

## Overview
This project is based on the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) course's project [Google Play Service](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/google-play-services). The main objective 
of the course is to learn using Google Play Services APIs. The app developed along the course will be able to share user's list
of things from a website called etsy and share it to the user's friends using Google plus.

The documentation for the app can be seen in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qpq1TOZdcafwf2vlD4fzlcM5qEDD0pzHMM3V89W7PqU/edit?usp=sharing).
